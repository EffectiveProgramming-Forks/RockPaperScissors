Need to add simple build script to run tests, produce executable jar, etc
Also should include instructions on how to compile/build/text in case user does not have any or Eclipse and how to play the game

Add UATs for bad user input (lower and upper case, enter without input, bad letter or string, etc)
Add UATs for multiple game arguments

** Need to keep coding from top down, don't assume you will need things at the bottom before you have a failing test
